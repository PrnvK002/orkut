            <h3>Hello,</h3>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              I'm orkut <br /><br />
              You may not know me but 13 years ago I started a social network
              called orkut.com while I was working as an engineer at Google. I'm
              the guy orkut.com was named after. In 2014 when Google announced
              that orkut would be shutting down, it was a sad moment for us.
              orkut had become a community of over 300 million people and was
              such an amazing adventure for all of us. Nobody wanted to lose
              what we had created together. We met amazing new people. We went
              on dates. We found new jobs. We even got married and had kids
              because of orkut. We made it happen, together.
            </p>

              <p>
                hello is the first social network built on loves, not likes. I
                designed hello to help you connect with people who share your
                passions.<br /><br />

                hello connects us all. Think about it: you can say "hello" in
                any language and people will understand. "Hello" is probably the
                most widely spoken word in the world after "Okay." Aló, halo,
                ʾāllo, alô, hallo, alló, hello. Fear and hatred have no place
                when you make such a simple and friendly gesture to someone
                else. So come join me, and make some new friends. Say hello, and
                love your world.
              </p>

                <p>stay beautiful,</p>
